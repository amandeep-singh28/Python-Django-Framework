****What is Django?****
It is a free and open-source framework for building web apps with Python.
It is not the only one framework in python but it is the most popular one.
It helps us to build a website in a fewer lines of code.
It comes with a lot of features so we don't have to code it from the scratch.

****Django features****
(i)The admin site
An admin interface for managing our data.
(ii)Object Relational Mapper(ORM)
That abstracts a database, so we can query the data without writing a lot of SQL code.
(iii)Authetication
Package for identifying user
(iv)Caching

****Installing Part****
So, in Django we make use of pipenv because it creates a virtual environment.
Suppose there are two projects (A and B) we need to work on this project but on project A use 3.2 Django version and for project B use 5.0 Django version.
So if we install Django globally than one version over writes the another.
That's why we make use of "pipenv"
