*****Creating our first app****
Every django project is a collection of apps.
Check on settings.py, you will see some installed apps.
These apps are by default installed.
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin', -> Admin interface
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions', 
    'django.contrib.messages', -> Displays one time notification to the user
    'django.contrib.staticfiles', -> For serving static files like images, CSS files
]
session -> It is a temporary memory on the server for managing users data. So in these days we don't use this. Remove it
Each app provides a certain functionality.

****How to create own app****
python manage.py startapp <name of app> (playground)
When we create app, every app has the exact same structure.
(i)migrations -> For creating the database tables
(ii)admin module -> How admin interface will be working
(iii)apps module -> Where we configure the apps
(iv)models module -> Where we define model classes for this app, we use this to pull out data from the database and present it to the user
(v)tests module -> For unit tests
(vi)views module -> request handler

****Register for the app****
Everytime, you create a new app, you have to register it on the settings.py file.
Just add the name under INSTALLED APPS 'playground'


****What are views(views.py)****
HTTP is a request response protocol. So every data exchange involves a request and a response. This is where we use VIEWS in Django.

In the views.py, we create view function -> Which takes a request and give a response.
It is a request handler.

->Creating our first view function
Go to your app -> views.py
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    def say_hello(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello World")

NOTE:-After creating view, we need to map the view to the URL, so when we get a request at that url, this function will be called.

Add a new file in playground named it as urls.py
In this module we are going to map our views
Every app has its own url configuration.

    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    # URL Configuration module
    urlpatterns = [ # urlpatterns must stay as it is, because Django looks for this only
        path('playground/hello/', views.say_hello)
    ]
views.say_hello -> It means we are not calling it, we are doing it via reference



After doing this, we are goiing to import this URL CONFIGURATION to the main URL CONFIGURATION.
Go to urls.py.
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('playground/', include('playground.urls')) # This means that any URL which will be start from playground/ do that task only
]

As playground/ is already mentioned, remove it from the urls.py(playground)


****Templates****
Django Templates are used to return HTML pages to the client.
render is used to render a template to the client.
    from django.shortcuts import render
    # Create your views here.
    def say_hello(request):
        return render(request, 'hello.html')
With the help of third parameter (mapping) in render, we can return a string to the HTML page
    return render(request, 'hello.html', {'name' : 'Amandeep'})
In the hello.html
    <h2>Hello {{ name }}</h2>


****Debugging Django Applications in VSCode****
This is useful when our output doesn't matches with the desired output. We can check line by line and see where exactly things are going wrong.
Click on Run & Debug, Create a launch .json file, Select Django.

Open Json file, you will see a dictionary in which configurations are stored
In the args, it is responsible on which port your server will be running, ADD one more port "9000" because on 8000 our previous server is running.

Now go to the Run & debug, add some dummy code in views.py 
def say_hello(request):
    x = 1
    y = 2
    return render(request, 'hello.html', {'name' : 'Amandeep'})
And add a breakpoint at x = 1, this will run the code before x = 1
Now START DEBUGGING, you will see that port number is changed and when you open that link, nothing will be shown because breakpoint is added.
Press f10 to go the next line.
Like this you can debug your Applications.

****NOTE****
Always remove your breakpoints after debugging the code


****Django Debug Tool-Bar****
pipenv install django-debug-toolbar
After doing this, go to Settings.py and add under INSTALLED APPS 'debug_toolbar'    
Add this into the urls.py(storefront) path('__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls))
Add this into MIDDLEWARE(settings.py) "debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware"
Add this INTERNAL IPs:-(Paste it anywhere in the settings.py file)
    INTERNAL_IPS = [
    # ...
    "127.0.0.1",
    # ...
]

****NOTE****
It will only works with proper HTML page.
That's why it is not showing a toolbar because we have only this in out html file
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <h2>Hello {{ name }}</h2>

****Models****
python manage.py startapp store
python manage.py startapp tags

Created these two apps, store them in the settings.py file

->Creating Models
Go to store app and open models.py. Create two model classes Product and Customer.

models.Model -> It is a base class that is provided by the django. If you will not inherit it than you will not be able to create database table.

Django automatically creates primary key for every model that we create. If you want to create your own primary key:-
    sku = models.CharField(max_length = 10, primary_key = True)

->Creating Choices
It's like a dropdown
MEMBERSHIP_BRONZE = 'B'
MEMBERSHIP_SILVER = 'S'
MEMBERSHIP_GOLD = 'G'

MEMBERSHIP_CHOICES = [
    (MEMBERSHIP_BRONZE, 'Bronze'),
    (MEMBERSHIP_SILVER, 'Silver'),
    (MEMBERSHIP_GOLD, 'Gold')
]
membership = models.CharField(max_length = 1, choices = MEMBERSHIP_CHOICES, default = MEMBERSHIP_BRONZE)
