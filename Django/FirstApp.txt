*****Creating our first app****
Every django project is a collection of apps.
Check on settings.py, you will see some installed apps.
These apps are by default installed.
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin', -> Admin interface
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions', 
    'django.contrib.messages', -> Displays one time notification to the user
    'django.contrib.staticfiles', -> For serving static files like images, CSS files
]
session -> It is a temporary memory on the server for managing users data. So in these days we don't use this. Remove it
Each app provides a certain functionality.

****How to create own app****
python manage.py startapp <name of app> (playground)
When we create app, every app has the exact same structure.
(i)migrations -> For creating the database tables
(ii)admin module -> How admin interface will be working
(iii)apps module -> Where we configure the apps
(iv)models module -> Where we define model classes for this app, we use this to pull out data from the database and present it to the user
(v)tests module -> For unit tests
(vi)views module -> request handler
